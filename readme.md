# advent of code 2019

these are my solutions along with a framework i am using.

it features:
- fetching puzzle inputs
- helper functions to interpret input
- test cases runner

see `template.py` for an example.

the `data` that is fed to the functions has some additional properties:
- `int_lines`: interpret each line as a number
- `ints_lines`: extracts all numbers from each line
